We used Xampp to run our code with php. In order to run our project, you will first need to make sure that Xampp is installed. Next, navigate to you htdocs folder (located at "C:\xampp\htdocs" for windows) and move the WebPortal project folder into htdocs. Once you have placed the project folder into htdocs, run Xampp and start Apache.
Before you start the application make sure that everything has been configured in the "WebPortal/config.php" file. There are 4 variables you will need to manage: $host, $username, $password, and $database. Make sure $host is "localhost", $username is the user you will be logging in as for your database (usually "root"), $password is the password for your database user, and $database will be the name of the database where all the information will be stored (the value for this should be "webportal_db"). When you the application for the first time through your browser, the database should create itself. Every time after that, it will use the existing database originally created.
Using your browser, navigate to the localhost Xampp is using (e.g. in your browser url: "localhost/WebPortal/index.php" or "192.168.64/WebPortal/index.php"). This should bring you to the main page of our website. 
There is no GUI for assigning roles, so changing roles must be done manually through the database. There are 3 roles: manager, ta, and student which are represented as 1, 2, 3 respectively. The student has access to Home and Give Feedback views, the ta has accessibility to Home as well as the My Schedule views, the manager has access to Home, Management, and Student Feedback views.
